#ifndef _SASMASTERLOCK_H

/*
*	
* DESCRIPTION:
* This file contains the SasMasterLock class which is intended to be
* used by the TPC-C benchmark.  The user should create one and only one
* SasMasterLock object and it can be used to facilitate inter-task and
* inter-thread locking of user objects.
*
* ASSOCIATED CLASSES    FILENAMES
*       SasLockList     SasLockList.H
*       SasUserLock     SasUserLock.H
*
* USAGE:
*	-One task creates the SasMasterLock object (at this time,
*       size must be 256) and puts it in SAS storage
*	-Tasks and threads may now use the lock() and unlock() methods on
*	the MasterLock object (assuming they have addressability
*	to the MasterLock) to synchronize access to an object.
*       For example:
*               (1) lock(myObjectAddr, SasUserLock__WRITE);
*               (2) // do something with myObject...
*               (3) unlock(myObjectAddr);
*
*       NOTE:  A thread may obtain multiple write locks or read locks
*       on a given object.  However, if a read lock is obtained first,
*       attempting to obtain a write lock afterwards will cause the
*       thread to hang.  Conversely, if a write lock is obtained first
*       it is possible for the thread to later obtain a read lock.
*
*       -This class also enables collection and printing of lock table
*       statistics, such as distribution info (i.e., load factor) and
*       usage.  The printHighLevelStats() method prints load factor
*       info and other totals.  printDetailedStats() prints info
*       on each table entry containing one or more locks, and also
*       prints out how many times each lock was locked (usage).
*       In order to collect and print this detailed information, the
*       user must compile with "collectstats" defined.
*
* DESTRUCTION
*	-If the MasterLock object is newed-up by the user, then it
*       is the responsibility of the user to delete it.  This is
*       probably the only way that TPC-C would create a MasterLock.
