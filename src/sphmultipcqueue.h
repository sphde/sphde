/**! \file sphmultipcqueue.h
*  \brief Shared Persistent Heap, multi producer multi consumer queue.
*	For shared memory multi-thread/multi-core applications.
*	This implementation uses transactional memory operations to
*	implement Lock Free Producer/Consumer queues (SPHMultiPCQueue_t).
*
*	This API supports atomic allocation of storage for queue
*	entries for zero copy persistence and sharing. Zero copy queues
*	divides the process of producing a queue entry in to three steps:
*	- Allocate the queue entry (and initialize the header)
*	- Use the return entry handle to fill in application specific data.
*	- Marks the entry complete in the header.
*
*	\code
#include <sphlfentry.h>
SPHLFEntryHandle_t *handle;
typedef struct data_struct11 {
	double	field0;
	int		field1;
	int		field2;
	void	*field3;
} data_struct11;

// Allocate zero copy queue entry
handle = SPHMPMCQMultiAllocStrideDirectSync (pcqueue);
if (handle)
{	// insert data into the allocated queue entry
	sphLFEntryID_t tmpl;
	data_struct11 *struct_ptr;

	tmpl = SPHMPMCQGetEntryTemplate(pcq);

	struct_ptr = (data_struct11 *)SPHLFEntryDirectGetFreePtr(handle);
	if (struct_ptr)
	{	// store struct fields directly into allocated queue entry
		struct_ptr->field0 = data_double1;
		struct_ptr->field1 = data_int2;
		struct_ptr->field2 = data_int3;
		struct_ptr->field3 = (void*)sas_data_buff2;
	} else {
		printf("SPHENTRYALLOCSTRUCT(%p, data_struct11) failed)\n",
			   handle);
	}
	// Mark the entry complete and available to the consumer
	SPHLFEntryDirectComplete(handle)
} else {
	while (SPHMPMCQMultiIsQueueFull(pcqueue))
	{
		// pacing code
	}
}
*	\endcode
*
*	The consumer can access queue entries once they are marked complete.
*	The consumer:
*	- checks (spins) for the next allocated entry to become complete
*	- uses the returned entry handle to directly access the entry contents
*	- When done processing the queue entry, it marks the entry header
*	invalid and deallocates the entry
*	- This makes the next queue entry available, if any
*
*	\code
#include <sphlfentry.h>
SPHLFEntryHandle_t *handle;
typedef struct data_struct11 {
	double	field0;
	int	field1;
	int	field2;
	void	*field3;
} data_struct11;

// Get next queue entry
handle = SPHMPMCQGetNextCompleteDirectSync (pcqueue);
if (handle)
{	// insert data into the allocated queue entry
	data_struct11 *struct_ptr;
	struct_ptr  = (data_struct11*)SPHLFEntryGetNextPtr (handle);
	if (struct_ptr)
	{	// access struct fields directly from queue entry
		data_double1	= struct_ptr->field0;
		data_int2	= struct_ptr->field1;
		data_int3	= struct_ptr->field2;
		sas_data_buff2	= struct_ptr->field3;
	} else {
		printf("SPHLFEntryGetNextPtr(%p, data_struct11) failed)\n",
			   handle);
	}
	// Mark the entry free and available for reuse
	SPHMPMCQFreeEntryDirect(pcqueue);
} else {
	while (SPHMPMCQIsQueueEmpty(pcqueue))
	{
		// pacing code
	}
}
*	\endcode

*	In this implementation the allocation of the entry is serialized
*	using Transactional Memory for atomic updates.
*
*	As an option the queue entry allocator will fill in a 4 or 16 byte
*	entry header with: 
*       - Entry status and length.
*       - Entry identifying Category and SubCategory codes. 
*       - Process and Thread Ids.
*       - High resolution timestamp.
*
*	Any additional storage allocated to the entry (after the header)
*	is available for application specific data.  This API also provides
*	several mechanisms to store application data including; direct
*	array or structure overlay, and a streams like mechanism.
*	The API provides a completion function (SPHLFEntryDirectComplete)
*	which provides any memory barriers required by the platform and
*	marks the entry complete.
*
*	The API support simple circular queues and requires a constant
*	entry stride. A stride that matches or is multiple of the
*	cache line size can improve performance by avoiding
*	"false sharing" of cache lines containing multiple queue entries
*	across cores/sockets.
*
*  \todo Additional work will include automatic pacing with Hysteresis
